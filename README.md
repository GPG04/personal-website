Hello there! My name's Gavin Goff! Whoever's reading this, I hope you have a wonderful day, and I wish you luck on all your future endeavors! <br>

The purpose of this repository, simply put, is an opportunity for you to learn about me! That, or I'm just going pelt you with an egregious amount of ipsum text. Either way, I hope we can become friends!
